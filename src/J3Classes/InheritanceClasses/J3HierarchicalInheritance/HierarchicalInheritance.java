    // Hierarchical Inheritance involves multiple classes participating in inheritance where one class serves as a superclass (base class
    // or parent class) for the rest of the classes. In other words, more than one sub-class extends the
    // same super class. The idea behind Hierarchical Inheritance is to create a specialization of classes.
    // For example, consider a class Animal that has a method called eat() and sleep(). Now, we can create
    // multiple sub-classes like Dog, Cat, and Lion that inherit the Animal class. Each of these sub-classes
    // can have their own methods and properties. The eat() and sleep() methods can be overridden in the
    // sub-classes to provide specific implementations.

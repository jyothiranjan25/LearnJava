    //Inheritance in Java
    //Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
    //The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).
    //The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
    //Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
    //Why and when to use inheritance
    //For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
    //For Code Reusability.
    //Java supports the following inheritance types:
    //Single Inheritance
    //Multilevel Inheritance
    //Hierarchical Inheritance
    //Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)
    //Hybrid Inheritance

    // for example check InheritanceClasses/*.java

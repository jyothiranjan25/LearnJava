    // An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
    // Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
    // Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods.
    // Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
    // An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
    // An interface cannot extend a class.
    // An interface can extend multiple interfaces.
    // An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.
    // To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kind of like inherited) by another class with the implements keyword (instead of extends).
    // The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class.
    // The Java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method. Moreover, it adds public, static and final keywords before data members.
    // All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
